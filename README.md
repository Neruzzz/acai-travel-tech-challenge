# Technical challenge documentation by Imanol Rojas
## First steps
- I modified the Makefile such that the contents of the environment file is exported at runtime. This automates the projet deployment making it scalable to new tokens and environment variables.
- I moved Acai documentation to the `doc`folder so the reviewer sees my documentation first. The original documentation can be found [here](/doc/README.md)
